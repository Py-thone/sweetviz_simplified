Sweetviz is an open source Python library that generates beautiful, high-density visualizations to kickstart EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) with a single line of code. Output is a fully self-contained HTML application.

The system is built around quickly visualizing target values and comparing datasets. Its goal is to help quick analysis of target characteristics, training vs testing data, and other such data characterization tasks.

This module makes it easier to analyze data using sweetviz and also access the data using pandas csv reader capability

Sweetviz currently supports Python 3.6+ and Pandas 0.25.3+.

For the module to work, you'd thus be required to have installed both pandas and sweetviz packages

Install pandas: pip install pandas

Install Sweetviz: pip install sweetviz
